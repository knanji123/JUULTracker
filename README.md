## About Me

Hello! My name is Kumail Nanji and I am currently studying Software Development.

I love designing.

I am a self-taught designer in which I have been designing for over 5 years. To me, graphics are very important because they really convey an important message on how the user/person reacts to your website or brand. I have taken several courses online in order to learn the graphic design basics, and the rest is just my creativity. 

The one thing about me is that I cannot stay focused on one thing at a time. Im always jumping around from development to design and making sure the the design is in par with the development.

Have a look at my work, I hope you get some inspiration and let me know if you like what you see (it really goes a long way)

## Thank you!
